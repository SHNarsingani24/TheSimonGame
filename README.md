# TheSimonGame
While learning jQuery, I have created The Simon Game using HTML, CSS and jQuery(3.5.1).

In this game, there are 4 buttons of different colours(red, yellow, blue, green). After clicking any button of your keyboard computer will show you animation on one button(with sound - e.g., red) and you have to click on that. After that computer will show you another button(e.g., blue) and you have to click now both the buttons in same order(first red and then blue). Computer will keep on adding the buttons to the pattern on every level and you have to click buttons in the same order to move on to the next level.

Try it out. Best of luck👍🏼.
